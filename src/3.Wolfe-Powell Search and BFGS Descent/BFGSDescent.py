# Optimization for Engineers - Dr.Johannes Hild
# global BFGS descent

# Purpose: Find xmin to satisfy norm(gradf(xmin))<=eps
# Iteration: x_k = x_k + t_k * d_k
# d_k is the BFGS direction. If a descent direction check fails, d_k is set to steepest descent and the inverse BFGS matrix is reset.
# t_k results from Wolfe-Powell

# Input Definition:
# f: objective class with methods .objective() and .gradient()
# x0: column vector in R ** n(domain point)
# eps: tolerance for termination. Default value: 1.0e-3
# verbose: bool, if set to true, verbose information is displayed

# Output Definition:
# xmin: column vector in R ** n(domain point)

# Required files:
# t = WolfePowellSearch(f, x, d) from WolfePowellSearch.py

# Test cases:
# myObjective = noHessianObjective()
# x0 = np.array([[-0.01], [0.01]])
# xmin = BFGSDescent(myObjective, x0, 1.0e-6, 1)
# should return
# xmin close to [[0.26],[-0.21]] with the inverse BFGS matrix being close to [[0.0078, 0.0005], [0.0005, 0.0080]]
